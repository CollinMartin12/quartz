In the sense of Binary Logistic Regression we have essentially the following:

This denotes teh training grounds with w being the weights/parameters that we are trying to optimize for: denoted below is all the terms
- w: The weights or parameters that will give us the best fit line to seperate our data
- omega: is the sigmoid function also the 1/exponential which is the deciding factor if it is 1 or 0

We find the best w for the omega function by finding the argmax of the log likelihood function:

in this case we are actually minimizing because it is easier to minimize a function due to calculus reasons.
Some times we get the function to be convex and more often than not in deep learning thsi is not the case

### Binary Cross Entropy: 

The primary use of BCE is as a **Loss Function** during the training phase of a model (like Logistic Regression or a Neural Network).

- **Measuring Error:** It provides a single number that represents how "wrong" the model is across the entire dataset.
    
- **Guiding Gradient Descent:** Because the BCE function is **convex** (bowl-shaped), it has a clear bottom point. Optimization algorithms take the derivative (gradient) of this function to figure out exactly how to nudge the weights ($\beta$) to make the loss smaller in the next iteration.
    
- **Probability Calibration:** Unlike simple accuracy (which just counts right/wrong), BCE cares about **confidence**. It forces the model to not just be "right," but to be "right with high confidence."

### Gradient Descent
In some types of math (like Linear Regression), you can use a single formula to jump straight to the answer. This is called a "closed-form solution."

However, for Logistic Regression, the equation used to find the best parameters—where the gradient of the loss equals zero ($\nabla_{w,w_0}\mathcal{L}=0$)—**has no closed-form solution**. This means we cannot simply rearrange the equation to find the weights; we have to "search" for them.

**Iterative Search for the Minimum**
Since we can’t jump to the answer, we use Gradient Descent to find it one small step at a time.

- **The Starting Point:** The model begins with random weights ($w^{(l=0)}$).
    
- **The Direction:** It calculates the slope (gradient) of the **Binary Cross Entropy** function.
    
- **The Step:** It moves "downhill" in the opposite direction of the slope to reduce the error.
    

The update rule looks like this:

$$w^{(l)} = w^{(l-1)} - \alpha f'(w^{(l-1)})$$

_(Where $\alpha$ is the "step size" or learning rate)_.

**Exploiting Convexity**
We use Gradient Descent because the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function is **convex**. Imagine a perfectly smooth bowl. Because it is convex, Gradient Descent is guaranteed to eventually find the absolute bottom (the global minimum) as long as the step size is chosen correctly.

**Handling Large Data (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**
Calculating the "perfect" direction using every single piece of data in a massive database is **expensive and slow**. To solve this, we often use **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** or **Mini-batch Optimization**.

- Instead of looking at the whole mountain, the model picks a random "mini-batch" of data to decide which way to step.
    
- This allows the model to update its weights much faster and handle "very large databases".
