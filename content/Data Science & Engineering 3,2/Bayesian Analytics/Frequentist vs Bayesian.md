### Frequentist: Long term relative Frequency
- $\Theta$ are a set of unkonw constraings
- Observed data
- Follows a *sampling distribution*
### Bayesian: A degree of subjective belief
- $\theta$ are **random variables**
- Combine with prior belifs
- Follows *Posterior Distribution*

### Frequentist Estimation
Estimators: *MLE, Method of Moments*
Solving for $\theta$ gives the **MLE estimator**: $$\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = \frac{x}{n}$$
- ${x}$ is the number of occurrences
- ${n}$ total data

### Bayesian Estimation
Model parameters are expressed as $\theta$ through prior distribution.

***Questions***: 
1. Assume a beta prior distribution, B(5,5), for the probability of head. Suppose we toss the coin 12 times and observe 9 heads and 3 tails. Obtain the posterior mean, median and mode. Compare with the MLE estimation.
```r
alpha = 5
beta = 5

n = 12
heads = 9
tails = 3
alpha_post = integer(alpha) + 9
beta_post = integer(beta) + tails


post_mean   <- alpha_post / (alpha_post + beta_post)
post_median <- qbeta(0.5, alpha_post, beta_post)
post_map    <- (alpha_post - 1) / (alpha_post + beta_post - 2)
cat("mean", post_mean, "median", post_median, "mode", post_map)
```
*mean 0.75, median 0.7642145 mode 0.8*
2. Read the file sms.csv. Asuming a B(5,5) prior and given 5000 data, obtain the posterior mean, median and mode. Compare with the MLE estimation.
```r
alpha = 5
beta = 5
data = sms
alpha_post = alpha + sum(data$type == 'spam')
beta_post = beta + (nrow(data) - sum(data$type == 'spam'))
post_mean   <- alpha_post / (alpha_post + beta_post)
post_median <- qbeta(0.5, alpha_post, beta_post)
post_map    <- (alpha_post - 1) / (alpha_post + beta_post - 2)
mle = sum(data$type == 'spam') / nrow(data)
cat("MLE Estimation",mle ,"\nmean", post_mean, "median", post_median, "mode", post_map)

```

### Bayesian Confidence Intervals
Based on prior: Bayesian credible intervals are based on the posterior distribution. A ${(1−α)}$ credible interval is any interval (a,b) such that:

***Questions:*** Assume a beta prior distribution, B(5,5), for the probability of head. Suppose we toss the coin 12 times and observe 9 heads and 3 tails. Obtain a 95% credible interval for the probability of head. Compare with frequentist intervals of the previous example.
```r
alpha = 5

# Bayesian Approach
alpha_post = heads + alpha
beta_post = tails + beta

confidence_interval = qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), alpha_post, beta_post)

***Questions***: Assume a beta prior distribution, B(5,5), for the probability of head. Suppose we toss the coin 12 times and observe 9 heads and 3 tails. Test the null hypothesis, H0 : θ≤0.5 against the alternative H1 : θ>0.5. Compare with frequentist results
```r
alpha_prior <- 5
beta_prior <- 5
freq_test <- binom.test(x, n, p = 0.1, alternative = "greater")
alpha_post <- alpha_prior + x
beta_post  <- beta_prior + (n - x)

prob_H1 <- 1 - pbeta(0.1, alpha_post, beta_post)
prob_H0 <- pbeta(0.1, alpha_post, beta_post)

```
--- Frequentist Results ---
P-value: 1e-12 
Conclusion: Reject H0 

--- Bayesian Results ---
P(H0 | Data): 0 
P(H1 | Data): 1 
Conclusion: The probability that theta > 0.1 is 100 %


### The Predictive Distribution Frequentist
The predictive distribution is expressed as:
$$p(x_{new} \mid \hat{\theta})$$

> [!WARNING] Parameter Uncertainty
> This method **does not fully account for parameter uncertainty**. It treats the estimate $\hat{\theta}$ as the "absolute truth," ignoring the fact that a different sample could have yielded a different $\hat{\theta}$.

## Bayesian Prediction: The Posterior Predictive Distribution

From the **Bayesian** point of view, prediction is handled by averaging over all possible values of $\theta$, weighted by their posterior probability. This is known as the **predictive distribution**:

$$f(x_{new} \mid \text{data}) = \int f(x_{new} \mid \theta) f(\theta \mid \text{data}) \, d\theta$$

***Question:*** Suppose we toss a coin 12 times and observe 9 heads and 3 tails. Predict
the probability that in the next 12 tosses you observe exactly 9 heads.
```r
p_hat <- 9 / 12
freq_pred <- dbinom(9, size = 12, prob = p_hat)
cat("Frequentist Prediction:", round(freq_pred, 4))

# Bayesian Predictions
alpha_post <- 5 + 9  
beta_post  <- 5 + 3  
predictive_func <- function(p) {
  dbinom(9, size = 12, prob = p) * dbeta(p, alpha_post, beta_post)
}
bayesian_pred <- integrate(predictive_func, 0, 1)$value
cat("Bayesian Prediction:", round(bayesian_pred, 4))
```
